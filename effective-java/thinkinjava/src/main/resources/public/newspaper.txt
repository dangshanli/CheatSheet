Apple Cracks Down on Apps That Fight iPhone Addiction

SAN FRANCISCO — They all tell a similar story: They ran apps that helped people
limit the time they and their children spent on iPhones. Then Apple created its
own screen-time tracker. And then Apple made staying in business very, very difficult.

Over the past year, Apple has removed or restricted at least 11 of the 17 most
downloaded screen-time and parental-control apps, according to an analysis by
The New York Times and Sensor Tower, an app-data firm. Apple has also clamped
down on a number of lesser-known apps.

In some cases, Apple forced companies to remove features that allowed parents to
control their children’s devices or that blocked children’s access to certain apps
and adult content. In other cases, it simply pulled the apps from its App Store.
